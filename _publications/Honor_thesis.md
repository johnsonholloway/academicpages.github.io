Many operational, research, and recreation activities rely on accurate forecasts of nearshore
wave information. Common forecasting methods rely on models built using equations rep-
resenting the underlying physics. These models contain parameterized representations of
dissipative processes leaving forecasts prone to error. This thesis investigates whether data
driven techniques can be used to improve wave forecasts relative to forecasts provided by a
state-of-the-art wave model. Specically, nonlinear time series forecasting and articial neu-
ral networks are applied to data collected from historical buoy records to make predictions
on wave data collected from a nearshore ADCP. These data driven methods are compared to
wave forecasts provided by a new deterministic wave model, the Nearshore Wave Prediction
System (NWPS). Results show that, even with the limited data provided, short term forecast
accuracy is increased with data driven techniques, thus providing hope that these methods
could improve wave forecasting over all time horizons.
